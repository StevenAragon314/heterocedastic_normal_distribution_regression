#### Heterocedastic Normal Distribution Regression
<p>The purpose of this code is to show the problems of 'Heterocedastic Lineal Regression.</p>

<p>Our team will be creating a code where different people can see what is happening with heterocedastic in a Lineal Regression, </p>
<p>where we will be creating a function where the values, in this case of 'n sample', will be changing of, and to compare the</p>
<p>if the test like Jarque Bera, kolmogorov-smirnov and Shapiro Wilk can detect heterocedastic in the residuals of the model of</p>
<p>regression, how the 'n sample' can show which are best models were, the last test, can detect normality in their distribution</p>
<p>of their residuals.</p>
 <p> Any user can have a normal distribution, but the theory, if have a normal distribution in a model so I will have a normal </p>
<p>distribution in a residuals no? This is not totally real becuase the user must be sure with graphic and different methods</p>
<p>where we can whatch if in fact we are having homecedastic or not. If someone is not sure about this aspect can have incorrect 
<p>conclutions, and to give incorrect information. For that reason, the researcher must do different test if they want</p>
<p>to be close of the real interpretation.</p>
 <p> As a researcher they must check different aspect of the investigation, but always the user must do the test? Well, that is the</p>
<p>question we want to simulate in a program, to whatch which are the values we can trust with the residuals.</p>
