#### Heterocedastic Normal Distribution Regression
The purpose of this code is to show the problems of 'Heterocedastic in a Lineal Regression.

Our team will be creating a code where different people can see what is happening with heterocedastic in a Lineal Regression, 
where we will be creating a function where the values, in this case of 'n sample', will be changing of, and to compare the
if the test like Jarque Bera, kolmogorov-smirnov and Shapiro Wilk can detect heterocedastic in the residuals of the model of
regression, how the 'n sample' can show which are best models were, the last test, can detect normality in their distribution
of their residuals.
  Any user can have a normal distribution, but the theory, if have a normal distribution in a model
so I will have a normal distribution in a residuals no? This is not totally real becuase the user must be sure with graphic and
different methods where we can whatch if in fact we are having homecedastic or not. If someone is not sure about this aspect can
have incorrect conclutions, and to give incorrect information. For that reason, the researcher must do different test if they want
to be close of the real interpretation.
  As a researcher they must check different aspect of the investigation, but always the user must do the test? Well, that is the
question we want to simulate in a program, to whatch which are the values we can trust with the residuals.
